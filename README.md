Small go library for mocking parts of the [time](https://golang.org/pkg/time) and [context](https://golang.org/pkg/context) packages.

## Time Utilities

The package contains a `Clock` and `Ticker` interface that wrap the `time.Now`, `time.After`, and `time.Sleep` functions and the `Ticker` struct, respectively.

A *real* clock can be created for general (non-test) use. This implementation simply falls back to the functions provided in the time package.

```go
clock := glock.NewRealClock()
clock.Now()                       // calls time.Now
clock.After(time.Second)          // calls time.After(time.Second)

t := clock.NewTicker(time.Second) // wraps time.NewTicker(time.Second)
t.Chan()                          // returns ticker's C field
t.Stop()                          // stops the ticker
```

In order to make unit tests that depend on time deterministic (and free of sleep calls), a *mock* clock can be used in place of the real clock. The mock clock allows you to control the current time with `SetCurrent` and `Advance` methods.

```go
clock := glock.NewMockClock()

clock.Now() // returns time of creation
clock.Now() // returns time of creation
clock.SetCurrent(time.Unix(603288000, 0))
clock.Now() // returns Feb 12, 1989
clock.Advance(time.Day)
clock.Now() // returns Feb 13, 1989
```

The `Advance` method will also trigger a value on the channels created by the `After` and `Ticker` functions.

```go
clock := glock.NewMockClockAt(time.Unix(603288000, 0))

c1 := clock.After(time.Second)
c2 := clock.After(time.Minute)
clock.GetAfterArgs()            // returns {time.Second, time.Minute}
clock.GetAfterArgs()            // returns {}
clock.Advance(time.Second * 30) // Fires c2
clock.Advance(time.Second * 30) // Fires c1
```

```go
clock := glock.NewMockClock()
ticker := clock.NewTicker(time.Minute)

ch := ticker.Chan()
clock.Advance(time.Second * 30)
clock.Advance(time.Second * 30) // Fires ch
clock.Advance(time.Second * 30)
clock.Advance(time.Second * 30) // Fires ch
```

## Context Utilities

If you'd like to use a `context.Context` as a way to make a glock `Clock` available, this
package provides `WithContext` and `FromContext` utility methods.

To add a `Clock` to a context you would call `WithContext` and provide a parent context as well
as the `Clock` you'd like to add.

```go
clock := glock.NewMockClock()

ctx := context.Background()
ctx = glock.WithContext(ctx, clock)
```

To retrieve the `Clock` from a context, the `FromContext` method is available. If a `Clock`
does not already exist within the context `FromContext` will return a new *real* clock instance.

```go
// Retrieve a mock clock from the context
clock := glock.NewMockClock()

ctx := context.Background()
ctx = glock.WithContext(ctx, clock)

ctxClock := glock.FromContext(ctx)
```

```go
// Retrieve a default real clock from the context
ctx := context.Background()
ctx = glock.WithContext(ctx, clock)

ctxClock := glock.FromContext(ctx)
```

## Context Testing Utilities

The package also contains the functions `ContextWithDeadline` and `ContextWithTimeout` that
mimic the `context.WithDeadline` and `context.WithTimeout` functions, but will use a
user-provided `Clock` instance rather than the standard `time.After` function.

A *real* clock can be used for non-test scenarios without much additional overhead.

```go
clock := glock.NewRealClock()
ctx, cancel := glock.ContextWithTimeout(context.Background(), clock, time.Second)
defer cancel()

<-ctx.Done() // Waits 1s
```

In order to make unit tests that depend on context timeouts deterministic, a *mock* clock can
be used in place of the real clock. The mock clock can be advanced in the same was a described
in the previous section.

```go
clock := glock.NewMockClock()
ctx, cancel := glock.ContextWithTimeout(context.Background(), clock, time.Second)
defer cancel()

go func() {
    <-time.After(time.Millisecond * 250)
    clock.BlockingAdvance(time.Second)
}()

<-ctx.Done() // Waits around 250ms
```
